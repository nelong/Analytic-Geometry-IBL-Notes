\endnote{I try to have students actually do this in class and note exactly what they did, while trying to point out the unconscious parts. They almost always draw a line with arrows on the ends, label 0, then give a scale. I describe this as choosing a space to work on, setting an origin, and setting a scale. This is called putting a coordinate system on a space.}
