\item Title of Course Notes: Plane Analytic Geometry

\item Abstract: This set of notes and problems covers a pre-calculus level course on topics in Plane Analytic Geometry. Sections of these notes include Coordinates and Points, Vectors, Polar Coordinates, Lines, Polynomials, Rational Polynomials, Conic Sections, and the Translation and Rotation of Coordinate Systems. The approach of these notes is a blend of computational and sense making problems that aim to have students connect algebraic ideas to corresponding measurement and geometric concepts.

\item History of Use: These notes have been used by two faculty members in six sections of a pre-calculus level course at SFASU over a four year period.
