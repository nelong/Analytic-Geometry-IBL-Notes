macro:->I
have
assigned
the
following
on
the
first
day
with
some
good
results.
I
would
encourage
you
to
find
a
way
to
make
sure
you
know
more
about
your
students
in
someway
throughout
the
first
week
of
classes.
\textbf
{First
Day
Assignment:}
Please
write
a
1
page,
typed
Math
Autobiography.
You
are
encouraged
to
write
candidly
about
your
math
experiences
from
elementary
school
until
now.
This
assignment
will
be
graded
for
effort
only.
I
have
put
this
assignment
up
on
d2l.sfasu.edu
so
you
can
submit
your
work
there
if
you
don't
want
to
have
to
print
out
your
work.

macro:->I
try
to
have
students
actually
do
this
in
class
and
note
exactly
what
they
did,
while
trying
to
point
out
the
unconscious
parts.
They
almost
always
draw
a
line
with
arrows
on
the
ends,
label
0,
then
give
a
scale.
I
describe
this
as
choosing
a
space
to
work
on,
setting
an
origin,
and
setting
a
scale.
This
is
called
putting
a
coordinate
system
on
a
space.

This
is
a
great
place
to
reinforce
the
precision
of
mathematical
notation
that
was
worked
on
so
much
in
the
first
chapter
of
these
notes.

macro:->I
would
suggest
doing
a
simple
motivating
problem
here.
My
suggestion
is
as
follows:
-Ask
students
to
graph
$3x+2y-4=0$.
\newline
-Walk
around
to
small
groups
while
they
do
this
problem
noting
how
they
approach
this.
Almost
all
students
(perhaps
unconsciously)
do
the
following:
\newline
-They
identify
the
shape
of
the
graph
should
be
a
line.\newline
-They
plot
the
graph
using
a
minimal
set
of
information
(namely
two
points,
then
connect
and
extend)\newline
-This
is
where
you
can
have
them
go
the
other
way
(find
an
equation
for
the
line
in
a
given
picture)
or
go
right
into
talking
about
building
the
correspondences
between
algebraic
forms
and
minimal
geometric
information
for
graphing.\newline
-This
last
chapter
is
about
understanding
some
semi-familiar
shapes
and
the
algebraic/geometric
forms
of
those
shapes.

macro:->Remind
students
here
that
without
Question
\ref
{q22},
they
can't
do
any
of
the
problems
in
this
section.
I
will
often
do
Question
\ref
{q22}
as
a
class
(let
them
work,
pull
together
for
a
quick
class
discussion;
or
have
them
work
in
groups
on
the
algebra
at
the
boards
so
everyone
can
see
how
to
write
things
up).
\@endanenote 
\@doanenote {9}
macro:->This
is
a
problem
that
will
build
and
test
the
students'
persistence.
You
will
need
to
decide
how
to
guide
them
through
some
of
the
algebra
in
this
problem,
including
the
suggestion
to
move
one
of
the
square
roots
from
part
d)
to
the
other
side
of
the
equation
to
simplify
the
algebra).
Getting
student
to
do
the
work
here
is
an
important
checkpoint
to
make
sure
they
are
ready
for
the
final
few
sections
of
problems
which
will
require
them
to
work
for
more
than
a
few
minutes
on
problems
that
are
not
easily
solved.
You
may
want
to
have
this
be
a
problem
that
students
work
in
class
and
present
results
as
you
go.

Question
\ref

a
class
(let

pull
together
for
a
quick
class
discussion;
or
have
them

on
